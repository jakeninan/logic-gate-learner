# logic-gate-learner
To learn the outcome of the combination we give as input in logical gates
The main use of this project is to find the output of different logic gates,that are AND,OR,NOR,XOR,NOT.
First we have to load logic(3)SQL,to the backend which you are using,(xamp),i've uploaded this file in my repositry.
Next proceedure to login to the page for that go to the main file find logichome.php then run it using net beans(am using net beans)
After running logichome.php ,we will be directed to a login page where you will have to login,username:Admin and password can be accesed from the logic(3)SQL 
After logging in there will be few options,and tabs where you can learn about gates and there basic functions if you are intrested
Going to the main part of the project where you can build gates,accordingly there will be 5 gates,choose the gate
Then we can give the number of inputs which will be 2,4,6,8 respectively
you can select any inputs in any order with any gate,the output is well rectified.
The main idea of this project was to make students understand what are logic gates and what are thier functions......................
